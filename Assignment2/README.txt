Read me for HW assignment 2 for Data Structs

I organized the programs into 3 different program folders, I hope they are easy to use. 

First is problem number 1 with a single linked list class created from scratch. It only includes the functionality that was 
listed in the requirements.

Problem number 2 was split into two program folders, one for the singly linked version, and the second for the doubly linked.
You might notice some comments about the head and tail pointers/nodes. 
The instructions were not perfectly clear, I was not sure exactly how he wanted the head and tail implemented, so I made my
linked list match the diagram he provided. 
Head and tail were shown as nodes with null data fields and pointers to either the first element or at the end of the list.
this means that head(null) has a next pointer -> to the first data node (1) -> ... -> tail(null).

I have always thought that head and tail were the names of the nodes that are at either the beginning or the end, 
so in the diagram after 1 and 2 are added to the list it would show head(1) -> tail(2) -> (null).
Since the diagram did not match my expectations, I did not implement it this way.

I hope this was how it was intended to be interpreted. If not, the diagram threw me off.

Thank you for your time.
